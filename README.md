#Xbot: A chatbot built on Rust

This chatbot is specifically made to cater to the XboxEra Discord server. If you want to fork this and use it for your own servers, go right ahead. 

How to Build
------------

Make sure you have the [latest Rust version](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed on your machine. 

This bot uses [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) in order to connect to the Discord REST API. Please make sure you install its dependencies in order to compile.

Contributing
